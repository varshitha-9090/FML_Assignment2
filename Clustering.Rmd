#Cluster 3:WPI, MRX, ELN, AVE- Lowest PE Ratio, Highest ROE, Lowest ROA, Lowest Net Profit Margin, Highest Rev Growth.
#Cluster 4:AGN, PHA-highest PE Ratio, lowest Asset Turnover, and lowest Beta.
#Cluster 5:JNJ, MRK, PFE, and GSK-Highest Market Cap, ROE, ROA, Asset Turnover Ratio, and Lowest Beta/PE Ratio

#Given the graph:
#Cluster 1: Despite the fact that the firms are evenly divided among AMEX, NASDAQ, and NYSE, it has a distinct Hold and Moderate Buy median as well as a varied count between the US and Germany. 
#Cluster 2: The highest median in this cluster is the Hold median, which also comprises unique Hold, Moderate Buy, Moderate Sell, and Strong Buy medians. They are on the NYSE and hail from the US, the UK, and Switzerland.
#Cluster 3: It has equal moderate buy and moderate sell medians, and distinct counts for France, Ireland, and the US, which is listed on the NYSE.
#Cluster 4: It is equally scattred in the US and Canada, with Hold and Moderate Buy medians, which is entirely listed on the NYSE. 
#Cluster 5: It is uniformly distributed across the US and UK, with medians of Hold and Moderate Buy, which is only listed on the NYSE.
#Considering the media recommendation variable, the clusters demonstrate a specific pattern:
#Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 has Hold Recommendation.
#Cluster 3, Cluster 4 and Cluster 5 has moderate buy Recommendation.

#Cluster 5 : Sustained cluster
